# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

# Lessons Learned:
It was fantastic practicing how to best utilize display flex as one method of creating reactive websites! Implementing media queries to change the color and layout as the screen size changed was phenomenal to see as well since doing so correctly comes to fruition instantaneously.
